## Project Structure
### Business Understanding
- Context: 
    - The real estate market is highly competitive, with property agents needing accurate pricing models to match clients with suitable properties.
- Problem Statement: 
    - Property agents struggle with accurate price estimation, leading to potential overpricing or underpricing, which affects sales efficiency and client trust.
- Objectives: 
    - Develop a predictive model for property prices and a client matching algorithm to improve transaction success rates.
- Success Criteria: 
    - The model should minimize errors like overprediction (leading to prolonged listing times) and underprediction (leading to underselling).

### Data Preparation
- Data Splitting: 
    - The dataset was split into training, validation, and unseen (test) data to ensure robust model evaluation.
- Feature Selection: 
    - Key features influencing property prices were selected based on prior analysis and research.
- Transformation: 
    - Log transformation was applied to the target variable to handle skewness, and features were standardized.

### Modeling
- Algorithm Used: XGBoost Regressor (XGB 1) was chosen as the final model after extensive hyperparameter tuning and comparison with other models.
- Metrics:
    - Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Focused on for its straightforward interpretation in currency units.
    - Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE): Provided a percentage error to understand relative prediction accuracy.
    - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): Used to penalize larger errors more significantly.
- Cross-Validation: Ensured model consistency and prevented overfitting.
- Feature Importance: Identified key features like ocean_proximity and median_income as primary drivers of property prices.

### Model Evaluation
- Validation Performance:
    - MAE: 31,468.66
    - RMSE: 50,181.79
    - MAPE: 0.164405
- Unseen Data Performance:
    - MAE: 29,479.52
    - RMSE: 45,805.06
    - MAPE: 0.153654
- Business Impact
    - The model provides property agents with accurate price predictions, helping them make informed decisions and improve client trust.
    - By reducing the risk of mispricing, the model contributes to faster and more successful transactions.

## Deployment
### Model Deployment
- The final model was saved as california_housing_1990.pkl.
- The model can be deployed via:
    - WebApp Integration: A user-friendly web interface for property agents.
    - API Deployment: Accessible through an API for integration into existing property management systems.

### Future Work:
- Model Improvement: 
    - Continued monitoring and updating of the model based on new data and market changes.
- Business Expansion: 
    - Extending the model to include more features or adapt to different real estate markets.
